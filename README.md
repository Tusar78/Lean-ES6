# Learn ECMAScript2015(ES6)
## New Version of JavaScript
**ES6:** ES6 is currently the most preferred version of JavaScript developers. But the problem is that it is not yet fully supported in all browsers. However, most of the features are supported now. But even then, since it is not fully supported, you have to be very careful in using it. Occasionally using a transpiler(like babel), the code of ES6 has to be taken in ES5.

**ES 2016, ES 2017, ES 2018:** These are also newer versions of JavaScript, but most of their features are not supported in current browsers. So these cannot be used directly.

Although ES5 is safest of these version here, you may see ES6 used in many frameworks. Most of these frameworks ensure browser compatibility when bundling your code or moving it to the production version. In that case you don't have to think about these. You can safely use ES6.

*But why ES6? Where is the problem in ES5? Yes JavaScript developers are very smart. Really smart. Even if you have to write a lot of line code in ES5, you can easily get the job done ES6 with a little code and a little hassle. Again, even after being JavaScript object oriented, many of the ES5 do no match the object oriented programming language. I will discuss the details one by one in the series. The biggest things is that as many JavaScript libraries or frameworks as you see, everyone uses ES6 by default. So you need to know ES6. Moreover, who doesn't like to work more smartly. ES: Learn, be a smart JavaScript developer.*
